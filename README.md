# Video-Streaming-Analysis

### Merge-Data
This folder contains the two data sets we plan to use. One is a dataset of all the Movies and TV Shows available on Netflix, and the second is a dataset that holds the titles and ratings of certain Netflix television shows. The notebook in this folder does some analysis on these datasets, and also combines the two data sets to form one data frame that holds all of the information we plan on using. Some rudimentary data cleaning was done by getting rid of rows without a user score, renaming rows, and reordering the rows.
